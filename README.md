# Image Sonification

A web application that converts images to audio (WAV) files and reconstructs images from sound. Now also supports encoding any file into an image and decoding it back!

## What is Sonification?

Sonification is the process of converting data from one form (in this case, visual data from images) into sound. Each pixel's color and position is mapped to specific audio frequencies and characteristics, creating a unique sound representation of the image.

## Features

This application allows you to:

### Image ↔ Audio Conversion
- **Image to Audio**: Convert images to audio (WAV) files with quality options
- **Audio to Image**: Reconstruct images from audio files
- Play the generated audio and visualize the waveform

### File ↔ Image Conversion (NEW!)
- **File to Image**: Encode any file (documents, executables, archives, etc.) into a PNG image
- **Image to File**: Decode PNG images back to their original files
- Perfect for storing data visually or sharing files in image format

### Additional Features
- Bulk processing support for multiple files
- Quality selector for image-to-audio conversion
- Preview and download capabilities
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Motivation

The initial motivation for this project was to understand compression algorithms and explore whether images could be stored in audio format. During this exploration, I discovered the field of sonification and decided to build a project that demonstrates this concept by converting visual data into sound and back again.

The file-to-image feature extends this concept further by allowing any type of file to be encoded as visual data, opening up interesting possibilities for data storage and transmission.
